    "#### Step 1: Introduction\n",
    "The primary aim of this project is to provide data-driven insights for a company looking to establish a new movie studio. With the entertainment industry evolving, the goal is to analyze existing film data to understand what types of movies perform best at the box office, helping the studio decide which genres, contributors, and themes to prioritize.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Objectives\n",
    "Our analysis will focus on the following objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Popular Genres**: Analyze which genres tend to have higher ratings and more viewer engagement.\n",
    "2. **Analyze Characteristics of High-Rated Movies**: Examine factors such as runtime, year of release, and genre combinations to see if they correlate with higher ratings.\n",
    "3. **Determine Key Contributors**: Identify directors, writers, and actors who have contributed to successful movies, as potential partners for the new studio.\n",
    "4. **Investigate Trends Over Time**: Look at how preferences in ratings, movie length, and genres have evolved over the years, highlighting trends that may be valuable for the new studio to consider.\n",

    "#### Step 3: Data Loading and Initial Display\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve defined our objectives, we will load the data and display the initial structure. I'll execute this step to provide a snapshot of each table’s structure.\n"
